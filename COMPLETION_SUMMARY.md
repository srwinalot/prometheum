## Implementation Highlights

### Validator System
The schema validation system includes robust validators:
- NotNullValidator
- RangeValidator
- UniqueValidator
- RegexValidator
- AllowedValuesValidator
- LengthValidator
- ColumnDependencyValidator
- RowValidator

### Pipeline Features
The pipeline system offers powerful capabilities:
- Conditional execution of steps
- Error handling and recovery
- Detailed execution tracking
- Fluent builder API

### Data Loading
Data loaders provide versatile options:
- CSV and JSON file loading
- SQL database integration
- URL-based data retrieval

### Serialization
Component serialization enables:
- Saving pipelines and transformers to JSON/YAML
- Loading previously saved components
- Sharing pipelines between projects

## Conclusion

The Prometheum framework now provides a comprehensive data processing solution with:
- Clean, composable interfaces
- Strong validation and type safety
- Detailed metadata tracking
- Flexibility for extension

All phases of the implementation plan have been successfully completed, and the framework is ready for use in data processing and analysis workflows.
