# Prometheum Framework Implementation Task Complete

I've completed the implementation of the Prometheum data processing framework according to the requirements. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

## Completed Components

1. **Data Module**
   - ✅ Data loaders for various sources (CSV, JSON, SQL, URLs)
   - ✅ Schema validation system with DataType, ColumnSchema, and validators
   - ✅ Advanced validators in schema.py (LengthValidator, ColumnDependencyValidator, etc.)

2. **Processing Module**
   - ✅ Transformers (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, MissingValueHandler, etc.)
   - ✅ Pipeline infrastructure with execution tracking and error handling
   - ✅ Fluent PipelineBuilder API

3. **Core Utilities**
   - ✅ Serialization support for all components
   - ✅ Comprehensive error hierarchy
   - ✅ Type hints and documentation

4. **Testing & Examples**
   - ✅ Integration test covering all components
   - ✅ Unit tests for validators
   - ✅ Example script demonstrating usage

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these design principles:

1. **Composable**: Components can be easily combined in different ways
2. **Type-safe**: Strong typing throughout with proper validation
3. **Documented**: Comprehensive docstrings and README
4. **Testable**: Well-structured for testing
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new components

## Verification

The implementation has been verified with:

1. A comprehensive integration test (tests/integration_test.py)
2. Unit tests for validator functionality (tests/test_validators.py) 
3. Example usage in a pipeline (examples/basic_pipeline.py)

## Documentation

The project includes:

1. README.md with installation and usage instructions
2. IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md detailing the status of all components
3. COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md summarizing the implementation plan fulfillment
4. Comprehensive docstrings in all code files

The Prometheum framework is now fully functional and ready for use in data processing workflows.
